# EPFL Course - Optimization for Machine Learning - CS-439

[Official coursebook information](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/optimization-for-machine-learning-CS-439)

`Lectures:` Fri 13:15-15:00 in [CO2](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room=CO2)

`Exercises:` Fri 15:15-17:00 in [BC01](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room==BC%2001)

This course teaches an overview of modern mathematical optimization methods, for applications in machine learning and data science. In particular, scalability of algorithms to large datasets will be discussed in theory and in implementation.

### Exercises:
The [weekly exercises](../../tree/master/labs/) consist of a mix of theoretical and practical `Python` exercises for the corresponding topic each week (starting week 2). Solutions to theory exercises are available [here](../../tree/master/lecture_notes), and for practicals in the lab folder.

### Project:
A `mini-project` will focus on the practical implementation: Here we encourage students to investigate the real-world performance of one of the studied optimization algorithms or variants, helping to provide solid empirical evidence for some behaviour aspects on a real machine-learning task. The project is mandatory and done in groups of 3 students. It will count 20% to the final grade. Project reports (3 page PDF) are due May 29th. Here is a [detailed project description](../../raw/master/labs/mini-project/miniproject_description.pdf).

### Assessment:
Final written exam in exam session, summer 2020. _Format: Closed book. Theoretical questions similar to exercises. You are allowed to bring one cheat sheet (A4 size paper, both sides can be used), either handwritten or 11 point minimum font size._
For practice: [exam 2019](../../raw/master/exams/exam2019.pdf), [solutions 2019](../../raw/master/exams/exam2019solutions.pdf), [exam 2018](../../raw/master/exams/exam2018.pdf).
